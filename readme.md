## NodeJS API with Multi Threading

This project has two endpoints: 
    -/primes/multi
    -/primes/single

and returns all the prime numbers in a given series of numbers.

It should be taken into account that until some amount of data, single thread might perform faster. 
Purpose of multi threading in this project is to optimize heavy calculations over big volumes of data.

You can run it with: `npm start` or `npm run dev` to run it on development (debug)
